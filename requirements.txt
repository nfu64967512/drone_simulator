# Requirements by category:

## Essential Dependencies (Required)
# These packages are absolutely required for the simulator to run:
# - numpy: For numerical computations and trajectory calculations
# - pandas: For CSV file parsing and data manipulation  
# - matplotlib: For 3D plotting and visualization
# - psutil: For system information display

## GUI Dependencies
# - tkinter: Part of Python standard library (usually pre-installed)
#   If not available, install Python with tkinter support

## Python Version Requirements
# - Python 3.8 or higher recommended
# - Python 3.7 minimum (some features may not work)

## Platform-specific Notes:

### Windows:
# All dependencies should install via pip without issues
# tkinter is included with standard Python installation

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
# sudo apt-get install python3-tk  # if tkinter not available
# All other packages install via pip

### macOS:
# brew install python-tk  # if using Homebrew and tkinter not available
# All other packages install via pip

## Installation Commands:

# Basic installation (required packages only):
# pip install numpy pandas matplotlib psutil

# Full development installation:
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# Conda installation alternative:
# conda install numpy pandas matplotlib psutil
# conda install -c conda-forge psutil

## Version Compatibility Notes:

# numpy>=1.21.0: Required for improved array operations and type hints
# pandas>=1.3.0: Required for enhanced CSV parsing capabilities
# matplotlib>=3.5.0: Required for dark theme support and improved 3D rendering
# psutil>=5.8.0: Required for cross-platform system information

## Optional Features:
# If you don't need system information display, psutil can be omitted
# The simulator will work with older versions but some features may be limited

## Troubleshooting:

# If installation fails:
# 1. Ensure you have the latest pip: python -m pip install --upgrade pip
# 2. Try installing packages individually
# 3. For conda users, try conda-forge channel: conda install -c conda-forge <package>

# If tkinter is missing:
# - Windows: Reinstall Python with tkinter option checked
# - Linux: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
# - macOS: brew install python-tk (if using Homebrew)

## Performance Notes:
# For large simulations or many drones:
# - Consider installing numba for JIT compilation: pip install numba
# - Install matplotlib with optimized backends
# - Ensure sufficient RAM (4GB+ recommended for 4 drones)

## Virtual Environment Recommended:
# python -m venv drone_simulator_env
# source drone_simulator_env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# drone_simulator_env\Scripts\activate     # Windows
# pip install -r requirements.txt
